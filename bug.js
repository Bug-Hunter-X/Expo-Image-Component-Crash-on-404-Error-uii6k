This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote URI that returns a 404 error.  The `Image` component doesn't handle this gracefully, resulting in the application crashing or displaying a blank space. The problem stems from the lack of explicit error handling within the component's loading mechanism.  Standard image loading libraries often provide mechanisms to catch and manage 404s, but Expo's `Image` component, in this specific use case, lacks that functionality, leaving the app vulnerable to crashing. For example, if the URI is incorrect or the server is down, the app breaks.
